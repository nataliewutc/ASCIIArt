## What it does 

An ASCII image generator where it takes an input image and turns it into ASCII art. 
The code gets the brightness pixel data from the image and allocates a character to the pixel depending on its brightness. 

## Why I made it 

A summer project to utilise and further python skills learnt in the first year of university. 
To further this project, I will be learning WebRTC and coding a video call platform which would have a video display of ASCII images.
